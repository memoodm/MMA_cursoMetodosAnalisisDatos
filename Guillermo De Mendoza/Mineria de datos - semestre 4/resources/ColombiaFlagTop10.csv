Courses are organized into learning careers and provide to their students the knowledge, concepts and enough experience to become profesional developers. Additionally, in order to increase the completion rate, their platform has a much more human approach to the teaching process, due to the fact that it promotes the interaction among students and mentors of a course in real time through chats and online live classes.  Their goals are: • Democratize and universalize education in Latin America, encouraging people to learn what they need to become professional developers in their mother tongue. • Contribute to reduce the deficit of qualified developers in the region, which in average is superior to 62%. • Make more accessible software development technologies to ethnically marginalized communities, in order to provide them the right tools to improve their quality of life. ￼",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Education, Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,1.0,Seed,2016-06-01,20000,USD,20000.0,Seed,20000.0,USD,20000.0,Seed,20000.0,USD,20000.0,20000.0,USD,20000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,"100,415",27.0,,,7.0,,,,,,,,,Colombia,Cali,Valle del Cauca,0
