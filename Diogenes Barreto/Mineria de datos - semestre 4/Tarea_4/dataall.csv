There are too many intermediaries that without adding value, they collect most of the profits.  We believe this is the result of the disconnection between farmer and consumer.  The actual model its that rural communities, end up being poor communities, that means they get bad services, (health, education, drinking water, connectivity, public services), and seen as a whole is not right that those who sacrifice to feed us ending up as the most vulnerable. This is unfair, unacceptable & unsustainable.  We all have to eat and we depend on the farmers to keep producing food, so we have to reconnect with them, we must improve their living conditions and restore dignity and sustainability to the countryside. Given the need to improve income conditions and thereby positively affect health, education, and connectivity, we created a mobile application that allows the farmer to self-certify how he produces their products. The application is a ""Task Manager"" where they are asked to demonstrate how they produce and like Instagram, the form will be for one or several photos, videos and/or some text, all will be georeferenced to the GPS coordinates where their farms are and linked to their digital identity we provide, the tasks are the same as they have been doing for years, but that consumers do not know.  The farmer download the App, fill out their profile and then add information about what they are producing.  The first ""task"" will be to walk the farm, with that we create a ""digital farm"" where the following tasks will have to be executed so we can certify the traceability only of the products produced within those GPS coordinates, the information of the execution of the tasks will be open and will be managed in a public blockchain so that anyone can see the process, in addition, the farmer contributes with social data to tell his story and connect with the buyer on a more emotional relationship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agriculture and Farming, Software",1.0,Nicolás Millán,1-10,1.0,Seed,2019-04-01,,,,Seed,,,,Seed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"297,400",4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide and install devices that monitor resources in real-time that submit information to our IoT platform (Aurora). The platform analyses the information and provides several metrics such as hourly/daily/monthly consumption, resource trends and projections, peer comparison, among others. Our solution helps companies drive efficiency, detect anomalies, increase comfort, and improve quality & performance. Our devices have been installed in production lines in factories, distribution centers, and fast food and breweries stores to get a glimpse of their resource efficiency.   At the cold chain solution, our goal is to monitor the temperature and humidity of industrial and commercial refrigerators to ensure that equipment works between expected temperature and humidity thresholds. Our solution helps track events such as temperature rising, doors left open, or abnormal motor activity that can lead to food loss, quarantine, transportation, and unnecessary supply replenishment. Data captured is sent out to our IoT platform (Aurora) to be analyzed. If unexpected behavior is found, alerts and notifications will be sent to the maintenance team to check the equipment performance. This solution allows knowing the state of the cold chain, facilitating operational decisions, reducing operating and maintenance costs while protecting reputation and corporate image.   At the audience monitoring solution, our goal is to help marketing teams understand store customer visits and their demographics. We use cameras and devices with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, to help identify people's characteristics and behavior in real-time. When used at a store lobby, a marketing team can fine-tune their value proposition by understanding metrics such as hourly and daily number of visitors, visiting schedule, time spent, age/gender and other demographics, interaction with POP material, flow/traffic and queues, store use coverage, among others.

On the other hand, the businesses through a Web Panel can see all the metrics to measure the effectiveness of its campaigns: number of visits to its branches, most viewed offers, more shared offers, among others.
