Unplanned pregnancies and the spread of STIs are at an all-time high and continue increasing worldwide. 45% of all pregnancies are unplanned, and nearly 500 million new cases of STIs are registered every year. Millions more go unreported.  The main reason behind this is a lack of access to condoms.  Systemic impediments, such as struggling education channels or rooted taboos obscure discussion when it comes to sexuality; for a staggering number of people, obtaining condoms can be a daunting task. This paradigm is not exclusive to developing countries. Rubberit is attacking this situation head on. Their members receive a monthly delivery of condoms, with as much discretion as their privacy-needs elicit. Simultaneously, the same amount of condoms purchased through this platform is taken by rubberit to communities under precarious economic conditions in their pilot country, Mexico.  Those donations are accompanied with a campaign of sexual health and education that leaves a long-lasting, tangible benefit to these remote localities. Their expanding client-base consists of incensed young men and women who want to take control of their sexual and reproductive rights.

After the government of Carlos Salinas declared the state mining company bankrupt, Larrea purchased key Mexican copper mines in Cananea and Nacozari (cities in the state of Sonora). He also purchased numerous other mining sites, including coal mines in the state of Coahuila. By 2000, Grupo México was responsible for 87.5 percent of Mexico's copper production and is the world's third-largest copper producer in the world. Grupo México has been in continual conflict with Local 65, the Cananea branch of the Mexican Mine Workers' Union (SNTMMSRM). During miners' strikes in January 2003 and October 2004, Grupo México responded with threats to close the Cananea mines.  In 2004, Grupo México has also purchased a controlling interest in the Southern Peru Copper Corporation. Grupo Mexico acquired 54.2% equity interest in Southern Peru Copper Corporation from ASARCO LLC, a mining company operating in the United States. The SPCC equity sale is subject to a litigation between Grupo Mexico and ASARCO pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas under District Court Judge Andrew Hanen. As of September 2009, ASARCO was the focus of a bidding war begun in May 2008 between its own parent company Grupo México and India-based Sterlite Industries.

Real matcha comes from Japan. Their's from the Nishio region which is where the finest matcha is produced. Like all tea, matcha comes from the tea plant, but what makes matcha so special is that it's grown under shade for two weeks before plucking. This causes the tea plant to go into ""overdrive"" and produce high amounts of chlorophyll (the bright green stuff that contains all the nutrients). The tea is then ground by granite stones to form a very fine powder so when you drink it you ingest all of the leaf and all of it's nutrients. This makes it very, very healthy. In fact, just one serving of matcha contains 15x the health benefits of regular green tea, 70x the antioxidants of orange juice, and 9x the beta carotene of spinach. In other words, drinking matcha is a fantastic way to help you achieve a cleaner, healthier lifestyle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food and Beverage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"212,560",4,,,,,,,,,,,
