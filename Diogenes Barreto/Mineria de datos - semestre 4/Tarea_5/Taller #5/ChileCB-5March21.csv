Attendance prediction: We analyze voters and other data to help the organizer book the right band.  Benefits list: Fans can access to benefits if they register to the list through a Facebook account and share the event.  Check-in: Attendees are checked-in through a mobile app when entering the show. This makes possible to generate analytics about how many people attracted each band, among other analytics.

For 15 years, Monkey Puzzle’s founder, Langdon F. Page, dreamed from his home in Los Angeles of the day when high-speed internet would allow filmmakers to work together regardless of their location. Since the mid-90′s he had felt an irresistible draw to the wild lands and timeless contradictions of the Southern Cone of the Americas. By 2011, the promise of an interconnected global community was finally becoming a reality, and Monkey Puzzle Media was born. The idea to form a production company in Chile with strong connections to the international marketplace captured the imagination of the recently-launched Start-Up Chile initiative, and Monkey Puzzle Media was awarded a $40,000 grant as a Round 2 participant. In it’s first year, 2012, Monkey Puzzle Media has forged strategic alliances with some of Chile’s best filmmaking teams. By bringing together Mr. Page’s experience making films with U.S. producers and directors, combined with the local know-how of Chilean talent, Monkey Puzzle Media can offer U.S. productions a location experience in Chile that has never existed before. On the remote collaboration front, Monkey Puzzle Media successfully edited three documentaries with directors in Los Angeles— a feature for HBO, and two shorts for 20th Century Fox— from it’s base in Santiago. Finally, Monkey Puzzle has been developing a slate of original productions with filmmakers around the world to be shot and/or posted in Chile and released worldwide. For it’s second year, Monkey Puzzle Media is actively working with local private and government entities to improve the film financing environment in Chile. Already tax-free for international productions, it is our hope that 2013 will be the year Chile will begin offering incentives to draw even more film projects to the riches which Chile has to offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Navigation and Mapping, Video",1,Langdon Page,1-10,1,Seed,2012-02-06,40000,USD,40000,Seed,40000,USD,40000,Seed,40000,USD,40000,40000,USD,40000,Start-Up Chile,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"185,711",13,,,6,,,,,,,,

Equally the T&T industry is seeking to improve and increase direct contact with their customers, as well as direct booking and marketing. To streamline their information and channel it towards their guests, uplift and maintain customer loyalty and satisfaction. Reach out to new audiences. Ultimately- to get closer and more social with travellers. On Frontierre travellers and T&T organisations and businesses are equals in their social interaction with each other, pursuing the common goal of discovering and providing better, unique travel deals and opportunities. The vision is to have all sorts of T&T organisations onboard – national tourism organisations and consulates, hotels, B&Bs and hostels, restaurants and cafes, museums and clubs, local guides and global travel guide services and databases interacting casually and socially with various travellers.

The advantage of the izit is that it combines both promotion and loyalty in the same application and gives users the distinct benefit of receiving geo-referenced promotions from multiple brands without having to download a brand specific application. The integrated loyalty feature enhances the promotion feature by rewarding users through the collection of virtual tokens called “bananas” which can be redeemed for actual products and services. The bananas are planted virtually in the world and are found at different times and quantities, creating a gaming experience similar to Pokemon GO, but with real benefits which can be redeemed directly in on our In-App banana store. This interactive process of collecting bananas in the world and redeeming actual products is different from traditional loyalty programs in which the consumer needs to purchase an item before they receive benefits.  In izit’s case, the user collects bananas in the world and is able to redeem them for products without an initial purchase. This difference creates a similar effect as an in-store promoter who gives you a sample to try for free with the intent of generating interest in the product and ultimately a sale. This same process now can be done virtually for any product through izit. From a Brand or retailer perspective, izit is a platform that can now be used to improve the shopping experience for their clients before, during and after their store visit. Izit addresses the challenges of delivering promotions at the point of sale, of attracting a critical mass of users, and delivering instant value while the user is physically shopping. Based on recent campaigns, izit has delivered an average Return on Investment (ROI) of 75% to a leading client using this channel.  In principal, the contextual mobile channel should be considered as a complimentary and natural extension of Social and Search to enhance the customer journey. Although similar to these channels, contextual marketing is also distinct in that the messages sent are generally executed through push notifications and by combining this with geo-referencing technology, contextual marketing enables brands to efficiently control what is published to their clients at the precise moment they are near or in the store. Since launching in 2013, izit has executed over 5,100 campaigns and have sent more than 125 million messages. Our results closely confirm industry findings and forecasts related to this channel and it is effectiveness when messages are delivered contextually. On average, izit achieves an industry leading mobile click-thru-rate (CTR) of 30% across most campaigns and true or Point of Sale conversions between 5 and 10% depending on the brand category. The use of the izit channel is beneficial to the brands by helping to enhance branding, accelerate purchases and to generate in-store leads. Izit has recently been awarded a research grant on Artificial Intelligence and is currently participating in other contextual marketing research in collaboration with researchers at the University of Chile, California, and Maryland.  The izit solution consists of a front-end smartphone application that has been designed to work on Android and IOS mobile platforms. The backend technology consists of a series of applications to manage, publish, and track promotions as they are published in established geo-fences. The izit platform is hosted on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud and has been architected to be fully scalable with the goal to expand to other countries. A new version of izit is scheduled to be released at the end of this year and will include a direct payment feature in which users will be able to make direct purchases of promotions, saving time and further improving the experience for izit users. Izit currently has a patent filed related to our geolocation technology in Chile (No. 2013-01957) in September 2017 and have patent pending applications in Brazil and US.

It´s headquarters are in Santiago , Chile. Around 13 people work there, mainly game developers and artists. History AmnesiaGames was founded in 2006 by Alejandro Woywood and some of his students from his course “game creation” of the Universidad Católica.  In the beginning, games were made for mobile telephones (using J2ME, SMS and WML technologies).  Back than the company decided to make games in a work-for-hire sheme, making games and apps for clients such as McDonalds, Advertising Agencies, Mobile Operatores, etc. ,  securing a regular income that allowed the company to grow safe and steadly. AmnesiaGames´ big break came in 2010, in a regional contest by Nokia, where AmnesiaGames resulted in being winners. This is the point where they began making their own games and publishing them. They also created and administrated the mobile portal of ENTEL PCS and CLARO from 2007 to 2012. Nowadays they create games and promotional apps. Competence AmnesiaGames´ strong point is their ability to make multiplatform 2D games. They programmed games for almost all mobile platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Flash, HTML5, NgCore, Qt, J2ME and Bada. AmnesiaGames developed a multiplatform engine that allows to target multiple platforms with the same code base. This means that the game development process ends with a compatible version for 6 to 8 platforms in the same time that another single platform engine makes only 1 version. There is of course some overhead (testing, QA, art) for every additional platform, but the programming is the same.  Games 31 Minutos (iOS and Andoid) World of Doodles (Facebook) Ninja Joe ( iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows) Ciudad McDonald’s (Symbian) Ninja Joe Undercover (Symbian) Balloon Buster (Symbian) Ninja Joe (J2ME) Combate Politico (J2ME) Shooting Range Simulator (C++,) And other games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Mobile, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"471,789",,11,,,,,,,,,,
