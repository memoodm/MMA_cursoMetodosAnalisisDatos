Since then, Live Nation has provided live entertainment services to fans in over 40 countries around the world through promotion and hundreds of entertainment venues. Live Nation partnered with Ticketmaster, the global leader in live event ticketing, in 2010 to form Live Nation Entertainment. This relationship has allowed both companies to expand their reach to help more fans experience the power of live each year.   Live Nation Concerts produces over 35,000 live music events annually in conjunction with Live Nation Entertainment’s 4,000+ touring artists. Live Nation fully acquired Front Line Management Group in 2011, giving the company access to the artists it represents, now numbering over 500, including top acts such as Chicago, Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett. Each of these businesses supports the Live Nation Network, the leading provider of entertainment marketing solutions. Live Nation Network connects more than 1000 advertisers to its network of consumers through Live Nation live event and digital platforms. Live Nation Entertainment has recently focused investments on profitable music festivals and initiatives associated with them. Some of the festivals Live Nation Entertainment has a controlling stake in include Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo. They also have a partnership with Insomniac who runs the Electric Daisy Carnival. Part of these investments include upgrading facilities at the festivals, including adding permanent bathrooms and running water. Live Nation Entertainment has an international presence, which has allowed them to acquire businesses around the world including the House of Blues (2006), a United States concert promoter; Union Events in Canada (2016) and Mainland Music (2018), based in Switzerland. It has also gained majority interest in AC Entertainment (2016), the Sweden Rock Festival (2016), Australia’s Secret Sounds Group (2016) and DF Entertainment (2018).",,,11,12,3,1,1,,,,,,,"Events, Media and Entertainment",1,Robert FX Sillerman,10001+,1,IPO,2020-04-27,518000000,USD,518000000,Post-IPO Equity,518000000,USD,518000000,Post-IPO Equity,518000000,USD,518000000,518000000,USD,518000000,Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund,1,1,37,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2005-12-23,,,,,,,,,LYV,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/live-nation-entertainment-ipo--a2984b5f,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange,,8,250,109,9,"12,581",38,7,131,Electric Communication Technique,Education; entertainment,8548180,USD,8548180,

If there is a piece of IT infrastructure anywhere in the world where performance matters, SolarWinds provides the technology to manage it. Whether you’re an army of one managing a small environment, an MSP responsible for multiple customers, part of an IT team managing an enterprise, or you’ve migrated to the cloud—if you care about IT performance—SolarWinds has powerful, easy-to-use, and affordable products to help you manage it. We distinguish ourselves by refusing to accept the status quo established by most technology vendors. Face it: The vast majority of IT management tools today are difficult to use, expensive, and really don’t address the realities of today’s real-world IT challenges. Too many IT pros have resigned themselves to accept the frustration. But we don’t think enterprise-grade software or services have to be so complex. We think that great technology not only makes it much easier to manage infrastructure, but empowers IT to actually delight end users. At SolarWinds, we’re fanatical about putting users first in everything we do. We strive every day to deliver powerful functionality that’s easy to use with one of the fastest and longest-lasting ROIs in the market. As a result, SolarWinds is one of the world’s most award-winning, peer-recommended and continuously-licensed product families year after year. Our approach is to deliver unexpected simplicity and redefine the management and monitoring expectations for all aspects of IT, MSPs, and DevOps pros. Simply put, we work to: Eliminate the complexity found in traditional enterprise software and services—we make it easy to find, buy, deploy and maintain solutions, regardless of an organization’s size. Connect with our community—we interact daily with our large, global user community to guide our product development and strategy, and foster an environment where users with even the most complex IT challenges quickly connect with experts who love to help. Constantly evolve our products—we ensure our software is on point to meet the most important problems that IT pros, MSPs, and DevOps engineers have today, and continues to deliver increasing value over the lifetime of ownership. Our company was built by IT administrators and senior systems engineers who know what it takes to manage today’s dynamic IT environments.

A team of physicists, led by Professor Marin Solja developed the theoretical basis for this novel method for wireless electric power transfer in 2005, and validated their theories experimentally in 2007.  The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field.  Prof. Solja team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This âœstrong couplingâ€ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.    Prof. Solja was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

Trust is the common thread that connects today’s elastic enterprise--trust that your identity solution will be there when you need it most and trust that your end-users know their information is safe.  The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform is the identity foundation to build secure, scalable and smart trusted experiences that connect people with technology. With OneLogin, seamlessly manage digital identities for your workforce and customers, so you can focus on what matters most--growing your business.  With OneLogin’s complete solution, you can easily connect all of your applications, leverage our proprietary machine learning to identify and analyze potential threats and act quickly using contextual authentication requirements. Secure: Security is the cornerstone of trust. It’s the confidence that your identity solution is reliable and always-on, so you can focus on what matters--growing the business. The OneLogin platform protects your organization against threats by securing and centralizing your applications, devices, and end-users all in one, easy-to-access place. Additionally, through our advanced machine learning capabilities, OneLogin can deliver real-time threat intelligence to help automate the process of keeping your business secure.  Scalable: The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform was built for performance and reliability at scale. With a wide breadth of extensible functionality, we can expand and retract according to the changing needs of your business. Through our enterprise-grade change management solutions, like our Enterprise Sandbox and API Access, you can quickly test large-scale changes before going live in your production instance. Our high availability Login Clusters elastically load-balance providing reliable, continuous service when you need it the most. That means if your database is impacted for any reason, your OneLogin environment won’t be impacted.   Smart: The risk of cyberattacks continue to increase as perpetrators look for smarter and less-detectable ways to circumvent security solutions. And for today’s businesses, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to implement solutions that evolve as the methods of attackers evolve. Although Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has become the defacto tool to protect end-user credentials and your business’ sensitive data, static authentication simply isn’t enough. Additionally, as identity management solutions seek to find more ways to secure the enterprise, user experience is often sacrificed, causing end-users to become increasingly agitated, often seeking out ways to evade having to authenticate several times.  Simple: Ease-of-use and speed-of-adoption are imperative to ensuring your identity and access management strategy is effectively rolled out across your organization. And in order to achieve that the solution you choose must be simple. And that means simple for you and simple for your users.  OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Citizen, Evernote, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Stitch Fix, and Uber. Solution highlights: * 100% on-demand * Pre-integrated with 6,000+ apps * Integrates with any web app * Market leading directory integration with LDAP, Active Directory, G Suite, Workday, UltiPro, and Namely * Single sign-on and self-service password administration * Automated user on-boarding and instant off-boarding * Role-based access control * Strong authentication with a mobile one-time password app * Two-factor authentication with OneLogin Protect, Duo, RSA, VASCO, SafeNet, Symantec VIP Access, and Yubico Yubikey * Identity compliance reporting * SAML 1.1/2.0, WS-Federation and OpenID Connect single sign-on * Custom connectors for in-house apps * Open-source SAML toolkits *Developer toolkits & APIs DIFFERENTIATORS: Recent OneLogin differentiating firsts demonstrating the company’s “bridge for authentication across cloud, on-premise, and mobile” include: OneLogin Access: OneLogin Access extends the reach of the OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform™ to applications hosted on-premises and in public or private clouds. We bring the benefits of the cloud to you: simplified administration reduced IT costs, improved security, and enhanced user experience. OneLogin Access eliminates aging Access Management tools that are complex, expensive, and disconnected from modern SaaS environments. Through the OneLogin portal, users enjoy a simple, consistent experience with single-click access to SaaS and on-premise applications from any device. OneLogin SmartFactor AuthenticationTM: As part of our Trusted Experience Platform™, SmartFactor Authentication leverages our Vigilance AI™ risk score to dynamically adjust authentication requirements in real-time based on the level of risk for each login, balancing security with usability. OneLogin’s SmartFactor Authentication uses machine learning to analyze a broad range of inputs, such as location, device, and user behavior, to calculate a risk score and determine the most appropriate security action to take for each login attempt. Depending on the detected level of risk, SmartFactor Authentication adjusts the number of authentication factors needed to log in. OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again. OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry’s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time. OneLogin Cloud RADIUS: OneLogin’s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Merakiwireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise — an area where other identity management solutions fall short. ACQUISITIONS:  In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin’s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor. In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin’s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises. RECOGNITION: In November 2019, OneLogin was named a 2019 Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Access Management Software. In September 2019, OneLogin was recognized in the G2 Grid as one of the top four leaders for Single Sign-On (SSO) software. In June 2019, OneLogin achieved a strong performer ranking for identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) in “The Forrester Wave™: Identity-As-A-Service (IDaaS) For Enterprise, Q2 2019.” In April 2019, OneLogin was named the 2019 G2 Leader and Top Performer in the following categories: Privileged Access Management Single Sign On (SSO) Customer Identity and Access Management User Provisioning/Governance.

The company simplifies the manual application process to one that is 100% online and automated. Businesses can use their business data to submit an application online and receive an answer in minutes instead of waiting weeks and filling out numerous forms like traditional lending methods. Businesses can access ongoing lines of credit up to $250,000. Kabbage leverages business data generated such as revenue, accounting data, business transactions, shipping data, social media and other sources to understand a business’s overall health and calculate credit lines throughout the customer lifecycle. The company began serving online merchants in 2011 and extended its automated lending platform to all small businesses – online and brick-and-mortar – in February 2014. In November 2013, Kabbage expanded its business to mobile with an iOS and Android app that enables users to apply or access their funds from their smartphones. Kabbage used to provide a consumer lending product, Karrot, but it is no longer available. Kabbage expanded the application of its platform in March 2015 by licensing the data and technology platform to power lending for other organizations. The company was named one of Forbes magazine’s Most Promising Companies list for the second year in a row. Kabbage further extended its lending reach in May 2015 with the announcement of the new Kabbage Card, which gives businesses the ability to pay for items at the point of sale with a purchasing card tied to their Kabbage account. Kabbage also collaborated with MasterCard in May 2015 to make Kabbage’s data and technology platform available through MasterCard’s network of acquirers. In August 2015, Kabbage was named the 36th fastest-growing private company in America on the Inc. 500 list. In October 2015, Kabbage completed a Series E funding round of $135 million led by Reverence Capital Partners. Holland’s ING, Spain’s Santander (via InnoVentures, Santander's venture capital arm); and Canada’s Scotiabank also participated in the round. Kabbage also announced a strategic partnership with ING to deliver instant capital to small businesses throughout Spain. In June 2016, Kabbage was named to CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list of the most forward-thinking and ambitious companies that are revolutionizing industries and markets worldwide. Two months later, Kabbage was named to the Inc. 500 list of the country's fastest-growing private companies for the second year in a row In August 2016, Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) upgraded and affirmed ratings on Class A2-2 Certificates issued by Kabbage Funding 2014-1 Resecurization Trust. The certificates were upgraded from BBB+(sf) to A-(sf) based on structural improvements to the transaction’s concentration requirements and the existence of more historical data relating to Kabbage’s collateral. KBRA also affirmed the ratings on the Class B2A Certificates of BB-(sf), Class B2B Certificates of BB-(sf) and Class B2C Certificates of B+(sf), which were initially rated in November 2015. In 2017, the company raised $250 million from Softbank Group Corp., raising its total equity funding to $500 million, making Kabbage one of the most well-funded companies with a female co-founder at the helm. It also secured the largest asset-backed securitizations of small business loans in the online lending industry of $525 million. In November, it diversified its debt-funding sources further with a $200 million revolving credit facility with Credit Suisse, earning investment-grade ratings of ‘A’ and ‘BBB’ by DBRS. It ranked on the Inc. 500 list as one of the country’s fasting-growing private companies for a third consecutive year, on Deloitte’s Fast 500 list, among CB Insights Fintech 250, in the top 10 of KPMG’s Fiintech 100, and its co-founder, Kathryn Petralia, was named one of Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women in the World.
