We are offering smart & reusable To-Go Packaging-as-a-Service to gastronomy clients & consumers. In Germany the consumption of take-away, convenience and delivery food & drinks is responsible for about 281 kilotons of single-use packaging waste for immediate consumption and is growing at double digit rates. Most of the time, To-Go food containers, snack boxes or coffee cups have a very short life-span of only 30 minutes after which they are tossed into trash (or litter parks, beaches & the ocean). This is not only a giant waste of economic resources as each single use costs between 15 and up to 0,60€ for a stable bowl/box with a lid. It is a horrendous waste of environmental resources (wood, water, crude oil, metals & energy) that are used to produce this packaging. Therefore, a single use packaging not weighing more than 30 grams can easily come with an ecological backpack of more than 8 kilograms when taking into account all the resources used in production (material intensities taken from Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy). Looking at GHG emissions, the picture is similarly bleak: Using CO2 emission factors and the detailed material mix of the single-use packaging waste analyzed by NABU (German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union), the 281 thousand tons waste from To-Go consumption generated around 556 thousand tons of CO2 or the equivalent of 195k passenger cars per year (assuming an average distance travelled of 15,000km). With the expected rise of take-away, convenience and delivery food, the related emissions are expected to increase at double digit rates as waste volume is expected to increase and as we saw a shift to plastics relative to cardboard or other materials. While there is a growing awareness of the problem, especially in Germany, there is no scalable solution yet and the commonly used alternative of nature-based & ‘biodegradable’ materials like bagasse or PLA also require many resources for production & transport, and have to be incinerated or go to landfill after use as there is currently no way to compost them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-10,2,Seed,2021-02-10,2000000,EUR,2423748,Seed,2000000,EUR,2423748,Seed,2000000,EUR,2423748,2000000,EUR,2423748,"Kai Hansen, HW Capital, Caesar Business Angels, Maze X, Sven Rittau",,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6,556",32,,,,,,,,,,,

But it is also responsible for 6% of the European CO2 emissions. Despite the fact that fuel consumption accounts for more than 30% of the costs of a truck fleet operator, fuel management and optimization is often neglected because of missing transparency. Tracks is a Berlin-based startup founded in 2018 aiming to make road freight more efficient, safer, cleaner and fairer. After starting off with the advances of platooning, our team now leverages the power of artificial intelligence and big data to help the industry reduce their environmental footprint and increase efficiency. Thereby we are getting closer to our vision of a future powered by sustainable freight transport. We use artificial intelligence to analyze fleet performance to provide fleet owners of any size with real-time performance analytics to empower road freight companies to increase fuel efficiency to reduce their energy consumption and ecological footprint. This includes advanced performance analysis of single vehicles, transparent efficiency comparison between vehicles and recommendations tools with actionable insights to increase efficiency of their fleets and help them make better decisions , all in a single-view dashboard. This significantly improves the customers’ bottom line and strengthens their competitive advantage in the market. Furthermore, Tracks enables effective CO2 emissions management to increase transparency and sustainability for shippers. This includes automated carrier emissions reporting, transparent overview of their performance and advanced performance analysis of single vehicles. A win-win for shippers and their road freight carriers. https://youtu.be/UaLGUJhVHcs?t=1502",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",2,"Christian Kruse, Jakob Muus",11-50,3,Seed,2021-01-26,2000000,EUR,2432794,Seed,2000000,EUR,2432794,Seed,2963000,EUR,3551674,2963000,EUR,3551674,"IBB Ventures, Future Energy Ventures, Investitionsbank Berlin, MobilityFund, Golzern Holding GmbH",2,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6,578",28,,,,0,1,,Scientific and technological services,,,,

By surmounting inherent flaws that plague other products, VMRay Analyzer has become the gold standard for malware sandboxing among leading DFIR teams worldwide.    The core of the VMRay Platform is an agentless, hypervisor-based sandbox, which is unique in combining near-total evasion resistance with full visibility into malware behavior: a trait we call X-Ray Vision. Because nothing touches or modifies the analysis environment, monitoring is invisible, and even the most evasive malware strains fully execute in the sandbox. By monitoring every interaction between malware and the target system, VMRay captures a complete and accurate record of threat behavior – data that enriches detection, incident response, digital forensics, and threat intelligence.  VMRay Intelligent Monitoring excels over other solutions in distinguishing between malicious behavior and legitimate activity. As a result, VMRay Analyzer delivers precise, noise-free output that reduces false positive rates to near zero.

The widespread adoption of cloud native technologies such as containers and Kubernetes has made it easier than ever to operate and scale applications.

Testing is a critical part of the development process and one that’s in need of a major upgrade. Modern cloud native testing practices are largely driven by what’s feasible rather than what’s useful. Developers working on distributed microservices applications have been left without an efficient way to build, run tests, and troubleshoot in a production-like environment. Garden makes it easy to spin up ephemeral testing and preview environments for integration tests, manual QA, and development.

It enables car owners, fleet managers, and public transport companies to generate monthly revenues by selling non-personal geo-targeting data to advertisers in real-time. The special feature: UZE Mobility gives people back their data sovereignty! The data producers should decide for themselves if and to whom they sell which of their non-personal data. UZE Mobility has also developed its own digital vehicle displays (UZE Ads Kits). The UZE Ads Kits are approved e-paper displays for trucks and cars. This means that almost any vehicle can earn money as a data generator or advertising medium to subsidize the switch to green mobility.  Cars and trucks feed situational (e.g. weather, traffic) and socio-demographic geo-data (e.g. age, income, language) into the marketplace's data store. These non-personal environmental data are recorded by the vehicles during their journeys using novel sensors. This environmental data - which is not considered by the automotive industry - is programmatically traded on the UZE Mobility Data Store. This means that advertising customers purchase this targeting data fully automatically and in real-time to target their messages to their target groups in the urban and POS environment at the same time. UZE ads are as easy to manage as Facebook ads. ++ Examples ++ Thanks to the geo-targeting marketplace, training equipment can be advertised on the same vehicle at the sports stadium, and fine jewelry can be advertised in the exclusive district.

To address the growing challenges in software development and the increasing demands of clients looking to enhance quality levels, they have been looking for new opportunities and methods to enhance the functionality and user-friendliness of apps, websites, etc. Thanks to an increasingly digitalised world, crowdsourcing, which is the sourcing of tasks to a global online community, has found its place in the business world and especially the IT industry. The application of this new form of labour to software testing resulted in a new, innovative method known as crowdtesting. A major benefit of crowdtesting is the opportunity to have not only experts but also unbiased consumers performing software tests on their own devices and under real world conditions. This grants access to a nearly endless combination of devices, operating systems and software. Another advantage of this method lies in the selection of testers, who can be chosen based on numerous criteria and characteristics that reflect the product’s target group. Crowdtesters are available ad-hoc via the internet and ready to search for defects and usability issues without encountering operational blindness. As a result, businesses are provided with a huge amount of flexibility in allocating their resources. They were able to quickly convince their first clients and investors about the numerous benefits and opportunities of crowdtesting. In addition, the Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology (now Economy and Energy) recognised their business model’s potential and funded Testbirds in the form of the EXIST scholarship as well as the start-up competition, “IKT Innovativ”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Information Technology, Mobile, Software",3,"Georg Hansbauer, Markus Steinhauser, Philipp Benkler",101-250,3,Early Stage Venture,2018-06-13,7000000,EUR,8262453,Series B,7000000,EUR,8262453,Series B,11100000,EUR,13395772,11100000,EUR,13395772,"btov Partners, Seventure Partners, Bayern Kapital, BayBG, Tiburon",1,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,"23,650",48,,,17,0,7,,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,,,,

Moreover, Germany’s economy is by far the strongest and healthiest in Europe, and, in their opinion, will continue to remain so due to its numerous structural advantages: a vigorous SME landscape, (excessively) low interest rates given the economic upswing as well as the (excessively) low valuation of the euro, which encourages exports. The backbone of the German economy is made up not just of the well-known blue-chip companies traded on the DAX, but it is above all built on the country’s many listed and unlisted “second-tier” small- and medium-sized enterprises. And some of these SMEs have long since ceased to be the traditional family-owned-and-operated businesses of days gone by. Germany is currently undergoing a true start-up boom, and many German technology companies are not only able to hold their own against the competition from Silicon Valley and London – they are actually able to outperform them. Focus on 4 Sectors Over the years they have developed an explicit focus on the following four sectors: 1. Internet & Tech  2. e-commerce  3. Life Sciences  4. Media & Enter­tain­ment Heliad invests in both listed and unlisted companies in these sectors.  Investment Strategy Special Situations Their goal is to achieve long-term, above-average returns for their shareholders, which they have clearly succeeded in doing every single year since they introduced their new investment strategy in October 2012. In their opinion, this is only possible if one is willing to strike out in new directions and go the extra mile. Globally, and particularly in Germany, an excessive amount of capital is available primarily for “standard deals” (buyouts, venture capital, etc.), which causes valuations to rise and, as a result, returns to fall. By contrast, Heliad focuses on Special Situations during a company’s life cycle. For Special Situations special know-how and, above, all, active hands-on management are required. They do not participate in conventional M&A bids or invest in a company whose valuation is largely speculative. The following are good examples of potential Special Situations, though the list should not be considered complete since the challenge of Special Situations is precisely that each one represents a “special” and unique investment opportunity:     Restructurings/Turn Arounds:      These involve companies that possess a sound core, i.e. a good product, but that are confronted with structural problems – for example poor management, poor liquidity, slow sales, or a combination of issues.     Disruptive business ideas lacking the required entrepreneurial „kick“:      These are companies with ideas and business models innovative enough to revolutionize a sector, but whose management teams – perhaps because it’s their first time creating a company – need an investor/partner that can bring its network and experience to bear so that the company can quickly and fully reach its market potential.      Buy and Build, Role Up/Industry Consolidation & Platform Models:     Many companies do not make sense as stand-alone investments, or are simply too small for institutional investors. However, by bundling them into a larger structure that is able to generate synergies, they can become very attractive investments. Their principle focus is on providing equity, but, depending on the situation, they can also offer loans or mezzanine financing. Strong operative Management Team as guarantee for success They are entrepreneurs ourselves and as such firmly believe that outstanding, entrepreneurial management is the key to success. A company’s management is therefore by far the most important criterion when they are deciding whether or not to make an investment. The companies they invest in either already have an excellent team of founders and/or managers, or they are able – perhaps in the course of a restructuring – to replace the existing management team with managers they’re familiar with.     Subsequent to their investment, they work hand-in-hand with management and apply their extensive network and experience to quickly take the company to new heights. As part of standard corporate governance, they also actively exercise their shareholder rights as advisory council and/or supervisory board members.  Active Value Creation It is of high importance to invest under particularly favorable terms. Equally important, however, is to ask what needs to be done to resolve the problems outlined above so as to significantly increase the value of the company as quickly as possible. What is the catalyst that will allow the investment to take off? And will it then be in a position so that it can be sold at a profit? On the one side the old adage applies: “The profit lies in the purchase.” But profits can only be reaped at the time of sale. So thinking already at the time of investment about the divestment strategy makes a lot of sense. And in this the interests of Heliad shareholders and Heliad management are in perfect alignment, because the 20% profit participation for Heliad management only applies to actual, realized profits. Since catalysts are as varied as the investments themselves, the following list contains only a few examples. The critical factor, however, is not to wait until the situation improves but rather to proactively take the steps necessary to improve the situation:     Enlargement or replacement of the management team          IPO – a change in perspective:      They invest in both listed and unlisted companies but are above all interested in arbitrage effects that can be realized by taking private companies public.          Achieving ""critical mass"":     Many companies only become attractive to follow-on investors once they have achieved a critical mass in terms of revenues and profits. An active growth strategy, perhaps combined with an add-on acquisition strategy, offers a company wholly new prospects, thereby opening it up to entirely new strata of investors, which in turn increases its values.           Strategic relevance:     This applies to companies that are clearly future candidates for strategic buyers but which still need 2-4 years to be ""ripe for purchase"".     Or better yet:     a combination of several different catalysts Since they work constructively with all the stakeholders to implement the changes needed, their strategy can be succinctly described as “friendly activism.” Stock market listing provides high flexibility Heliad’s greatest advantage is that it is structured as a so-called “evergreen” vehicle, which means that, as opposed to a mutual fund or hedge fund, it is not subject to possible outflows but rather has permanent equity. The fact that Heliad is listed provides shareholders with liquidity since they can trade its shares daily. This allows Heliad to act independently of term financing and make both investment and disinvestment decisions on a case-by-case basis, which provides for a high degree of flexibility.",Private Equity Firm,"Early Stage Venture, Private Equity, Seed",16,27,22,8,8,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Financial Services, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,1,IPO,2017-05-11,2000000,EUR,2172699,Post-IPO Equity,2000000,EUR,2172699,Post-IPO Equity,2000000,EUR,2172699,2000000,EUR,2172699,BF Holding GmbH,,1,1,Made Acquisitions,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2004-11-10,,,,,,,,,HPBK,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/heliad-equity-partners-ipo--17da7eb1,ETR - Deutsche Börse XETRA,,,"38,456",1,,,10,,,,,37468,USD,37468,

Already in its prototype state, the new XO resealable can won the Can of the Year Award in Dubai in 2009 (Winner Silver - Category Prototype) and was enhanced and refined since, involving extensive market research and field testing. With the can now entering the consumer beverage market, they are confident that the product resembles a step forward for XOLUTION in becoming the market leader in this field.  XOLUTION GmbH is headquartered in Munich, Germany. In 2008, Marc von Rettberg was named Chief Executive of the company. He joined Christian Bratsch, Vice President R&D, to introduce innovative designs to the beverage packaging industry for reclosable beverage cans. Rettberg and Bratsch established new product design guidelines with a clear focus on values and benefits for the entire supply chain. The innovative beverage can ends were required to offer easy usage to the consumer (intuitive, easy to open and reseal), easy integration for the beverage filler in the existing processes (no major adjustments to the filling line), easy handling for the can maker (XO reclosable can ends based on standard shells), and improved commercialization for the beverage brand (unique branding options). And, of course, the focus was set on providing these benefits at a reasonable overall cost. In 2009, Can Maker Magazine recognized the XOLUTION innovative resealable can with the Silver Award in the Prototype category for the XO-400 reclosable beverage can lid. Since Time-to-Market is a key challenge for all innovators, Rettberg and Bratsch have created a competitive advantage of rapid prototyping and testing capabilities in their Salzburg R&D Center.  XOLUTION GmbH is managed by one of the most competent teams in the business. With long-term experiences in their respective fields, their leading specialists guarantee the best coverage of all business areas from prototyping, R&D and product management to trading and distribution. With their knowledge, the XO Resealable Can was successfully converted from a simple vision to a technologically sophisticated product that will have a significant influence on the canned beverage market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Administrative Services, Food and Beverage, Manufacturing",,,1-10,1,,2016-01-11,45000000,EUR,48875961,Venture - Series Unknown,45000000,EUR,48875961,Venture - Series Unknown,45000000,EUR,48875961,45000000,EUR,48875961,"Inventages Venture Capital Investment Inc., Inventure Management",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"39,225",12,1,,,36,9,Conveying; Packing; Storing; Handling Thin Or Filamentary Material,Common metals and their alloys; ores,,,,

Cuponation groups discount codes and offers for all online shoppers from 17 different categories, among which are: fashion, beauty, electronics or Travel. The goal of Cuponation upon arriving in Spain was to replicate a very successful model in the United States: that of discount coupons. This has nothing to do with companies like Groupon or Groupalia, but rather with companies like Retailmenot and Coupons.com. To enjoy a discount in Cuponation it is not necessary for the user to register, but just copy the discount code from the web and paste it on the website of the company where you are going to make the purchase. That is why those responsible for this platform understand Cuponation as ""the copy and paste of the coupons"". Cuponation continues its international expansion throughout the globe. In fact, the first country where it was installed was in India, as it is a very similar market to the United States. It was later launched in Brazil and Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, France and, finally, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity.  Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria. Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and our graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use ground-breaking algorithms to support analysis and decision making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. Our API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data. This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously.
