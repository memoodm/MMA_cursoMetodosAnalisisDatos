PG allows gamers play a wide selection of premium games from anywhere on their PC/MAC or TV for a low monthly fee.

The company was founded in December 2014 and it is based on Dr. Soucek’s scientific research in Omomyc (the best direct Myc inhibitor known to date) over the last twenty years. Currently, cancer incidence in the world exceeds 14 million cases per year and results in 8 million deaths annually. Moreover, such numbers are forecast to rise by 75% over the next 20 years (World Cancer Report. International Agency for Research on Cancer 2014). At the moment, standard therapies include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, in a restricted subset of cancers, precision medicine. Unfortunately, very often these therapies fail, due to the development of resistance. Peptomyc has adopted a different strategy based on the inhibition of the oncoprotein Myc, which is found deregulated in the majority of human cancers. Myc holds a non-redundant function in cancer around which tumors cannot evolve, hence targeting Myc is the most promising therapeutic opportunity to date.

Despite their best efforts, their WordPress sites on mobile devices were slow and sluggish. We got down to work and developed a mobile WordPress theme for them, called Frontity PRO. Our goal: to make it as performant as possible while delivering a remarkable user experience. To achieve that, we built an internal React framework which used the REST API to fetch the content of their WordPress sites, and spent the whole year optimizing it. We faced a lot of challenges and realized that combining WordPress and React wasn’t easy. But at the end, the theme was a success: it was used by more than 20 million readers and proven ideal for building engaging and modern frontend experiences. In 2019 we decided to use all that knowledge and lessons learnt to launch an open source framework, so anyone who wants to use WordPress as a headless CMS with a React frontend could benefit.

Etece said it plans to expand its coverage area, pushing out from the three Spanish cities it currently serves — namely Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia — to add four more “in the coming weeks”, namely: Seville, Malaga, Bilbao and Zaragoza. It has recruited 400 self-employed “problem solvers” to support its task-solving platform — with typical tasks including dog walking, cleaning, cooking and IKEA furniture pick ups. It’s clearly going to need to ramp that number up as it scales up to more cities but that process will likely be helped by tough times in the Spanish economy and especially high unemployment. It says it’s aiming to have 1,000 “problem solvers” supporting the business, by the end of 2013. Etece’s platform competes with traditional high street professional services providers by having its problem solvers compete with each other to win the business. It reckons this leads to an average 35% discount for the person wanting the task done.

Integrated with all the company's corporate management systems, with complete personalization and customization options, including commercialization as a white label product, available as a cloud-hosted (public or private) or on-premises solution. ***  Zyncro is an Enterprise Social Network, a private work environment for sharing information confidentially and securely, containing a social microblogging system, a document repository, a task manager, and a professional contact agenda.  Zyncro integrates with the leading business management tools:   *SharePoint   *ERPs, such as SAP   *BI systems (Pentaho, Google Analytics) and CRMs   *Project management tools, like Doolphy   *Google Apps: Gmail, Calendar and Drive   *Social Networks: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, RSS and YouTube   *Other corporate web applications: Evernote, SurveyMonkey   *With any web content generator... Zyncro uses social technology to enable organizations to:   *optimize and reduce email use   *improve internal knowledge retainment and management   *make teamwork more efficient   *motivate and involve employees in the corporate mission   *provide access to corporate information and documents. As well as being an enterprise social network, Zyncro can act as a Private Social Network, a space for collaboration and communication, perfect for any organization looking to build private social relationship with its customers, suppliers or partners... where contents and information generated do not belong to third parties (unlike Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) but to the users. Zyncro also has a multi-organization structure, making it a ideal solution not only for single enterprises, but for groups and business communities looking for a common space to share information, news, files, contacts and applications. The original Zyncro idea back in 2008 in the Grupo Inspirit technology laboratory consisted in creating a files synchronizer that would allow and individual to access all of their professional and personal documents ""in the cloud"".  Nonetheless, upon seeing the potential that this tool could have within a company, a more corporate approach was given to it each time.  At the same time, the ""surname"" social and the 2.0 style was inundating the Internet and it was then that the decision was taken to add collaborative and communicative functionalities to it that later converted it to what it is today: an intranet 2.0 or company social network.  This part of Zyncro‘s trajectory is what Didac Lee, founder of Grupo Inspirit, considers the a ""Journey accross the desert"", which all startups must endure.  Thanks to the appointment of Luis Font as Zyncro CEO in November 2010, the business strategy and product definition became polished and sales and marketing departments were consolidated until we became what we are today.

They believe in the need forspecializedservices andpartnersin this segment fordog-friendly businesses, destinations and other tourism agents. The company already has more than 25,000 registered with dogs and more than 1,000 active canine and dog-friendly business clients. All of them can find, through the web or mobile app, both museums and bars, as hotels, restaurants and other activities in which dogs are not only accepted, but also welcome . This last point is a widespread demand among those who opt for the company of a pet and, in this case, a dog, as they generally have to deal with restrictions and prohibitions of all kinds. Luckily the initiative of integration to the dog in the city is booming, and that is why every day Dog Vivant adds new dog-friendly and canine businesses, since more than 84% of people with dogs do, at least , one trip a year with your pet. In addition, 42% of these people refuse to make any type of trip that does not include their dog. However, this does not happen only in relation to travel and getaways, but more than 50% frequent a bar or restaurant with your pet, and almost 70% try to include you in all your plans as long as the dog is not uncomfortable .  In this way, Dog Vivant stands for dog travelers not as a business directory, but as a certification with proven and updated information from really dog-friendly sites . On the other hand, for these trusted businesses, the Dog Vivant certification offers a complete ecosystem of services ranging from the visibility and qualified recruitment of dog adventurers (always knowing their dog access rules, opinions from third parties and nearby attractions), to customer experience and reputation management in a segment in full revolution. However, it should be added that the reception by these businesses is good, since the annual certification renewal  rate is close to 80% in a sector as volatile as hospitality and tourism. The company, which has the support of Metxa, has just closed a round for an amount of € 300,000, after a presemilla round of € 100,000, months after its foundation (2016).
