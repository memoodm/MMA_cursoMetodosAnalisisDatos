The work team includes both systems and communication professionals. The company’s experience with UX/IU, identity creation and handling AI algorithms allowed them to develop unique and flexible solution that can be adapted to the requirements of large or small companies. The system tracks start time, end time and breaks for working team members during the working day. It consists of a mobile application and a dashboard. When a person clocks in, the mobile application starts tracking the location and takes a selfie to verify the user’s ID. During the day, it records both the working time and the locations and itineraries until the user stops it by either taking a break or clocking out. Also can be implemented as a cloud service and provides agile management of working hours and time-off or vacation requests by personnel, and the days worked may be viewed on the dashboard or the mobile application. The mobile application can be used to send notifications to all personnel easily and directly and to set up and maintain a fluid communication channel between individuals and Human Resources. Fichap can be installed in tablets at fixed points to clock in and out by using facial recognition if geo-localization is not required. The system is in constant evolution and will soon add other features such as a hierarchy system, a gamification system with scores and benefits/incentives, frequent points and route enhancements. IMPORTANT: With the enactment of Royal Decree-Law 8/2019, in Spain, which establishes the obligation to register workers' days that forces companies to record the work time of their employees, the company decides to look for commercial agents and partners that can implement this system, both in Spain and in the rest of the European countries and Latin America. This solution can be offered both to SMEs and large companies. The system includes security measures for personal data storage, processing and transmission. It does not require any special hardware for operation and relies on the features of mobile devices to manage working hours. It incorporates artificial intelligence.  Competing products only focus on time control, disregarding user experience and the experience of employees, volunteers or member of the organization implementing the system. This proposal has well developed identity and usability and incorporates facial identification, thus avoiding the major weakness of competing products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Administrative Services, Apps, Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Lucas Mailland,11-50,2,Seed,2020-01-15,15000,USD,15000,Pre-Seed,15000,USD,15000,Pre-Seed,25000,USD,25000,25000,USD,25000,Aleksan Buyuk Kurt,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"81,010",49,,,,,,,,,,,

We have many examples of successful marketplaces out there which we all interact with in our everyday lives such as Uber, Amazon, grubhub, lyft, Netflix, Spotify among others. What do they have in common?   1. They solve people’s everyday life problems 2. They are convenient and the user experience (UX) is exceptional 3. They are 100% technological and smart  4. They are hubs that group thousands of products/services making the life of consumers easier, allowing them to, in a few clicks and in just one place, to find, compare, connect, engage and purchase. 5. They attend massive markets and they are scalable. MatchUP shares the same above qualities, but for an industry that has been 100% unattended until now. You can ask; Why would prospects go to a marketplace such as MatchUP to find a place to study? Because there is no other technological platform that offers in such a simple way, how to find, compare, check current students reviews, interact 24x7, and many other qualities, with universities from anywhere in the world in one place.  It’s a much easier way to discover options they might never have considered because they didn’t know about them, and our smart matching engine can pick out Universities that fit their profile in terms of geographic, study of interest, financial parameters, student culture, career aspirations, hobbies etc  Why should educational institutions use MatchUP?

The question woman ask themselves today is not “what’s new?” or “what’s on sale?” anymore, but they are rather curious about whom of their friends liked a product, who else is using that product, what are they saying about it and who else is buying it! Their business model therefore replicates the “purchasing process of beauty products” in a 3 step approach: TRIAL, RECOMMENDATION and AVAILABILITY. - TRIAL: “Woman like to try the product before buying it”  For trial they have developed Almabox, a subscription model in which woman receive a box with beauty samples. It’s a BEAUTY DISCOVERY SERVICE! Model is inspired in the US based Birchbox and European Glossybox. - RECOMMENDATION: having a friend or a professional recommending a product, is a powerful purchase driver. They bring the necessary tools to allow consumers interact with the products and their beauty specialists, and they do that through  social media and events in the real world. - And Finally, AVAILABILITY:  Penetration of beauty retailing in LATAM is limited, and finding the product everyone is talking about is not always easy.  For that they have developed Almashopping, their beauty e-commerce. At the end of the day, putting these 3 gears together makes a powerful mechanism. Alma Cosmerics is not the old marketing way, its the new way: Consumers market to each other and they build the path-to-purchase over the internet, where their consumers are! Building a community is the way to go to develop beauty e-commerce, and they believe the nature of the market in LATAM makes it the next big think!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Design, Media and Entertainment",3,"Ignacio Molins, Priscilla Maciel, Rita Almela",11-50,4,,2014-11-18,650000,USD,650000,Venture - Series Unknown,650000,USD,650000,Venture - Series Unknown,1225000,USD,1225000,1225000,USD,1225000,"NXTP Ventures, Finaves, Ennovva, Omar Calvo",,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"112,842",3,1,,6,,,,,,,,

So, citizens use the application to register risks and the NGO to deliver it to the people in charge of the solution. After that we asked ourselves ""What happens in organizations?"" And we saw a huge opportunity because there are many accidents in the work environment.  Here in Chile, there were more than 170,000 (one hundred seventy thousand) accidents in organizations last year. Moreover, we saw that the risk detection processes are manual (using paper), which results in decentralized information, useless for decision making. That is why we opened our platform for the organizations. so they can use our mobile application to search and register risks in their buildings using images and georeferentiation. Then, at the office, they can complete those registries, create reports and send them to the people in charge of the solution. But that is not enough, we are continually innovating; adding new features every month like guidelines to avoid the human errors or automatically risk detection through video cameras. So, why Ubicuo? Because we reduce four times the time needed to detect and solve risks and that, is translated as less workIng accIdents;… and also we centralize the information and provide statistics. How to acquire Ubicuo? It’s easy, by subscribing to one of our packages or asking for a quotation. Currently we have four paying clients, three hundred users, one hundred inspectors and more than five thousand risks detected.  We have to say thanks to StartUp Chile, because since the beginning of the program we have been duplicated our billing, we got a pilot in Santiago and we are closing a deal to get private investment.  Finally, the team. We have complementary profiles, specialists in different software areas and project management. but we have one thing in common: we love challenges. Also, we count on institutions and mentors that are expert in prevention to guarantee that our product satisfies market requirements.

Comenta TV tools give social producers access to a mass volume of data, enabling them to find relevant tweets in real time to analyze the behavior and integrate the social audience on air with one click. TV drives viewers to express emotions through comments on the social web. According to Nielsen 60% of TV viewers use social networks while watching TV and 30% comment about the shows they are watching. But it’s difficult for TV stakeholders to keep track of real time interactions that surround TV shows and brands. Viewers are sharing comments in Twitter in several different ways (using mentions, diverse hashtags or natural language), making it challenging to follow the conversation beyond Twitter hashtags. Most of the information is lost. The technology behind Comenta.TV was developed to solve this problem.By identifying viewers interactions we can offer real time metrics and analytics for networks, producers and advertisers, to help them better understand their audience (who, where, when, what, how engaged, from which source and how willing to share a show with their friends), increase engagement with custom visualizations and open new monetization’s opportunities. Comenta TV is giving TV networks and live events producers new tools to expand their business and give advertisers new windows to reach their BEST audience: - Algorithm to index every comment being made in social networks about a live TV show - First screen or on air integrations to engage the audience and increase the social reach of the show. - Real time analytics tools for TV shows and advertisers to better know their audience, and how influencers interact LIVE with their content and brands - Social TV brand affinity analysis to help brands in media buying decisions TV networks, advertisers and production companies are paying between u$500 one shot fees, up to u$5.000 subscription fees a month for Comenta.

Their motto is ""Collective Intelligence"". It is an open platform where people around the world can share their opinions, interests, and experiences democratically, as well as discover new ideas, information, and knowledge. The spirit of Taringa! is to be free, democratic, and open, giving millions of people a means to enable them to express themselves without intermediaries or censorship. The platform has a presence in every country in the Spanish-speaking world - its main markets are Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, Chile, Peru and the US Latino community. According to comScore statistics, it is the 4th most popular Latin American Social Network, as it receives 75 million unique visitors per month and is in the process of international expansion. It was one of the first Spanish web ""2.0s” in the world, born even before platforms like Facebook and Twitter, bringing the category ""social network"" onto the scene. Taringa! was created on January 11, 2004 (broadcast from April 14, 2004) by Fernando Sanz (Buenos Aires high school student).  Taringa! consists of a 27 million registered user base who create and share thousands of daily posts on general interest topics such as: Life Hacks, Tutorials, Recipes, News, Sports, Technology, Reviews, Art, and more. Along with Xapo’s Bitcoin wallet, a Silicon Valley company founded by Wenceslao Casares, Taringa! was responsible for carrying out the largest integration of Bitcoins in the world. The widespread incorporation of the virtual currency was made possible by its use as payment in Taringa!’s Revenue Share program, called “Taringa! Creators”. In February 2012 an article by Wired Magazine listed Taringa! as one of the foreign sites that ""outshine Facebook"" stating ""there are still places where an also-ran or a homegrown alternative beats out the global hegemonies"". In December 2013 Taringa is the largest Social network created in Latin America and the fourth one in traffic only after Facebook. The company is headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where there is a team of 40 professionals working in areas such as IT, Product Development, Sales, Marketing, and Administration.

In Agile Route we believe that projects are journeys, not destinations. Even very well charted paths can spring surprises when they are actually traversed. Our experience has shown us that adapting is the best way to actually get somewhere, finding shortcuts, preventing blockages and sometimes taking an unexpected detour that leads us into an even better place than the one we envisioned from the beginning. Like traversing an unknown path, a Business Project must adapt to its surroundings (its niche and competitors) and be prepared from the start to deal with the sudden changes in its environment (the market) in order to reach its goals. A Business Project must have the flexibility to change its mind, react, change directions or even explore unknown and perilous paths now and then in order to gain the advantage that means the difference between getting there first, or not getting there at all. Success if for the bold, and projects need change. We truly believe in change, we embrace it, and that is why the Agile Principles are a fundamental part of our DNA. To us, change is not an obstacle: it is our very fuel. We believe that not everything can be known beforehand, so our working process is based on being very close to the customer's mind, in order to quickly move to another direction, and also being very attentive in order to deal with the unexpected. We believe that every project is unique, and the best paths cannot be known beforehand, but discovered together. We believe in technical excellence, in simplicity, in highly skilled and motivated individuals, in traveling at a sustainable pace that can be maintained for as long as it takes to get there. In Agile Route we think that coding is fun, and developing an enjoyable and enriching experience. In Agile Route we strive every day to be proud of our work. Out there, in the business jungle, a healthy business is an ever changing business. Agile Route embraces that fact to be your route companion, all along the way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Information Technology, Professional Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"360,974",18,4,,5,,,,,,,,

At the same time, they allow profound customization regarding the visual features of the poll itself so that it is inserted seamlessly into your own social networking profile, website or email campaign. The possibilities are endless and only the user will determine how far he can take this service. However, the most important part of creating a poll or a survey is being able to retrieve the information in a useful way, otherwise all the hard work and effort will be going down the drain. With SisSurvey you can export the collected data in either XML or CSV format or you can even subscribe to an RSS feed of your results to keep track of your poll in real time. Another nice feature is the possibility of determining opening and closing parameters for your polls and surveys.

MABB transforms modern bioceramics into implantable medical devices. Through our Innovation Center, we turn your ceramic implant systems design and manufacturing ideas into a high-quality, reliable and low cost reality. We can produce large amounts of precision parts at a very low per-unit cost using Ceramic Injection Molding (CIM) technology. The revolutionary CIM process will give you the possibility of producing parts similar in shape to those available in plastic, while at the same time taking advantage of the advanced nanoceramics resistance and inertness. Our technology, along with the raw materials we have incorporated, translate into a revolution in the way implantable medical devices of complex shapes are manufactured, which were very difficult or even impossible to produce until now due to their high hardness and fragility during the process. MABB certified Quality System can provide the highest repeatability, a lower rate of rejections, and a statistical control of proven processes, thus our clients are able to avoid the dimensional inspection upon delivery. Through our proprietary system, together with strategic partnerships, we have transformed these products into medical products that reach the most varied international markets (FDA, CE, ANMAT [National Administration of Medicaments, Food and Medical Technology of Argentina], ANVISA [National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil], among others).   MABB’s human capital has specific and complementary knowledge. Our engineers will help you determine whether the part you want is suitable for CIM, considering its cost and shape, and you will be offered alternative design options to get all the benefits this process can give you. CIM offers greater design freedom than many other production processes, and it significantly increases productivity by simplifying manufacturing and minimizing costs.  Thanks to CIM’s technical virtues, not only will you obtain greater stability and optimization in the manufacturing process, but also a higher-quality product, much more competitive in the market than ceramic components manufactured using traditional methods. MABB integrates Ceramic Injection Molding (CIM), the latest technology for manufacturing ceramic parts. This technology does not require the machining intermediate process, lowering production costs and decreasing waste materials, which contributes to protect the environment.  The old Dry Pressing ceramic parts manufacturing process is well-suited for high volume production, but is limited to simple shapes which, in many cases, must later go through machining in order to get the final shape with the desired tolerances and surface finish. The CIM technology used by MABB can help produce parts with re-entrant angles, blind holes, internal and external threads, complex surface profiles, perpendicular holes, and intricate cavities in a single step and without intermediate processes.   A high-tech productive process for advanced ceramics. Ceramic Injection Molding (CIM) is a process that combines two different technologies: Plastic Injection Molding and Powder Metallurgy. The process basically consists in the Ultra-High-Pressure injection of ceramic powder into a mold shaped as the part to be manufactured. Step 1: Raw Material The raw material to be used is a blend of very fine ceramic powder (< 15 microns) with a primary paraffin material and a secondary thermoplastic polymer. These additives are called ""Binders"" as they bind the components and work as the vehicle the ceramic powder uses to flow through the injection channel. Unlike standard powder metallurgy, with which only 80-90% theoretical density can be attained, a 98-100% can be attained with CIM. This means we can achieve close tolerances and reduce costs by manufacturing small and complex parts in high-volume production. Step 2: Molding The pelletized raw material is placed in the injection pump hopper, where it is heated and then injected into the mold cavity at a pressure of up to 2,500 ATM. The product obtained at this stage is referred to as a ""green"" compact. Mold development engineering enables the production of parts with extremely complex shapes, using special alloy steels in their construction to extend mold life performance. When the part is taken out of the mold, even though identically shaped, it is 25% larger than the finished part due to the volumetric shrinkage it will go through when in the sintering furnace. Step 3: Debinding The removal of binding additives or debinding refers to a controlled thermal process carried out in a special furnace where a considerable portion of the binder is removed. The heating and cooling rate lasts 26 hours approximately and can evaporate up to 60% of the binder.  Step 4: Sintering A very fragile “brown” compact, with a small amount of binder still attached, is the result of the Debinding stage. The next step is introducing the part in a sintering furnace at a very high temperature. There, not only the remaining binder is removed, but the part is also shrunk until it reaches its final shape and mechanical characteristics. Sintering is the process of heating a material below its melting point, but at a temperature high enough so as to fuse its individual particles and thus achieve densification of the material. During sintering, the component has its volume reduced until it reaches its final shape. If the process is controlled carefully, it is possible to produce an even and repeatable contraction with close tolerances of around a hundredth of a millimeter. This renders any subsequent machining unnecessary. MABB is a leader in the production of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia implants.   MABB is a producer of innovative projects in other areas of the industry. Our team of renowned and highly professional Engineers at MABB enabled the expansion of our action areas into other markets and products, with the innovation and modernization of processes as our starting point.  MABB promotes and motivates devising new and innovative projects in other areas of expertise among all its members. Through our Innovation Center, we create partnerships and interrelationships with private and public players from the regional scientific field, to encourage and develop ""RUN ON, RUN UP."" Innovations will therefore follow one another, the search for knowledge never stops, and the application frameworks of the developed technologies keeps expanding, thus reaching the most varied areas of the industry.  The technologies and processes developed by MABB have been applied to the nuclear, health, aerospace and arms industries. Without losing MABB's focus on the development of implantable medical devices, we have taken on and completed other projects such as:   • Metal Injection Molding or MIM: This process offers design freedom unlike many other production processes based on machining with stock removal, thereby minimizing costs and increasing productivity and competitiveness. High-precision components in stainless steel, nickel-steel, copper, titanium, cobalt, and other metals and alloys can be manufactured through this process. • Precious Metals Electrolytic Coating: Through automation technologies of industrial metal electrodeposition processes we have designed and built an automated production line for high-precision 99.9% Silver and Gold plating. • Reabsorbable Polymers Injection: These polymers are a new generation of implants used in various trauma surgery techniques with the main benefit of a complete 3D bone regeneration after patient's bone reabsorption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Design, Health Care, Professional Services, Science and Engineering",2,"Daniel Miguez, Santiago Badran",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"561,121",18,,,11,,,,,,,,
