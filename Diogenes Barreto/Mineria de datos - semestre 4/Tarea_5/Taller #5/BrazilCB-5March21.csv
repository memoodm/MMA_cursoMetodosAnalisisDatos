Our hospital solution ORCHESTRA offers customers an innovative solution for their digital transformation in intensive care, with a focus on integrating data and information and remote monitoring of patients in a single management platform. The Carenet platform provides scalable and replicable technology for the construction of a Tele-ICU or a centralized clinical command center. ORCHESTRA as an integration system connects the hospital's hardware world with the software world in critical areas, such as the intensive care unit, the operating room and the emergency room. ORCHESTRA connects medical device data with a hospital's electronic health record system. This integration includes vital sign data from multiparametric monitors, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature; or it can be device-specific, such as mechanical ventilator settings, infusion and nutrition pump flows, patient weights and positions in the case of automated beds. The technological and functional development of the ORCHESTRA platform that took place over the past two years has been evolutionary: First, we provide a simplified approach to the integration of medical devices connecting virtually any medical device to any hospital system. Then, we contextualize the clinical data, providing mobile and real-time information about the patient, which facilitates early intervention and allows for better clinical outcomes. Currently, we have taken intensive care in the ICU to the next level, with a layer of Tele-ICU functionality that provides online access to the patient's telemetry to specialists who are remotely monitoring the patient's clinical condition and are able to work and communicate with the local team. The ORCHESTRA tool is modular and compatible with any telemedicine solution on the market. Therefore, ORCHESTRA modules can be coupled to pre-existing telemedicine platforms in the institution. Our vision is to develop the tools that create real-time intelligence, insights, predictive analytics and healthcare for a growing new market for clinical surveillance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Information Technology, Internet Services, Mobile",1,Immo Oliver Paul,11-50,3,Early Stage Venture,2020-05-15,2000000,BRL,341490,Series A,2000000,BRL,341490,Series A,4000000,BRL,865762,4000000,BRL,865762,"Wayra, KPTL",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"47,242",24,2,,21,,,,,,,,

The actual problem is that physical trauma patients are attended by non-specialized medical doctors in primary and secondary healthcare systems, or even inside the rescue ambulances, resulting in patient delayed delivery, without previous communication and lack of real-time data of trauma care chain. Using the TeleTrauma®, patient and trauma's data are imputed on the platform, with calculates the severity of seven different types of trauma, informing the best medical practice and the closest hospital with technical and human resources. By doing so, our client can deliver the patient to an adequate tertiary hospital communicating with trauma specialized medical doctors through telemedicine.  All data imputed in TeleTrauma® are displayed in a real-time dashboard panel for measurement of the efficiency of trauma care chain. In this case, the artificial intelligence has been applied to show the heat map of trauma for healthcare management efficacy.  Similarly, for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we launched amIA®. This platform provides initial support for non-specialized MD who receives patients with chest pain. After imputing the patient data and a regular photography of electrocardiogram (EKG), the amIA's AI network calculates the probability of AMI and offers the initial support, adequate hospital recommendations and telemedicine with specialized MD. So far, amIA® has analyzed 15.000 EKG with 95% of accuracy.  In 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemia, w3.care has developed the TeleCOVID®. That is an operational telemedicine platform for people with respiratory symptoms after answering a triage, patients are divided in two groups: low and high risk. The second group is directly forwarded to a medical telemedicine support with MDs. Lower risk patients are given WHO recommendations automatically and ask to return in case of impairment of their clinical condition. All data collected is shown on real-time dashboard with epidemiological, operational and geolocation big data.
