The drug candidates developed by the Company are targeted and their goal is to selectively destroy the cancer cells without affecting healthy cells (‘Targeted Cancer Therapy'). The approach is based on the identification of target genes, such as H19, that are expressed only in cancerous tumors, and not in healthy cells, and on the use of those genes' regulatory sequences for the activation of a toxin inside the cancerous cells only, thus destroying them without harming healthy cells. BioCancell's leading drug candidate, BC-819, has completed a Phase IIb clinical trial for the treatment of bladder cancer, as well as additional clinical trials for other cancer indications.

Traditional media outlets such as TV, radio and newspapers are declining and brands are being forced to evolve. Media is a two-sided coin: content and distribution. Many brands are missing distribution on mobile and are being left on the sideline. Brands can't get in front of their consumer as they used to, until now...

Its two products, the CerOx™ and the c-FLOW™, are bedside patient monitors based on the patented UTLight™ technology designed to provide physicians with unique monitoring solutions that are  imperative to individualized and personalized patient care. Both products enable precise, real time, continuous and non-invasive measurements of cerebral blood flow alerting physicians to variations in blood flow to the brain, thus enabling informed intervention for better clinical results and patient care.  Ornim’s CerOx™ monitor is the only device in the market today enabling simultaneous, non-invasive measurement of both blood flow and oxygen saturation; while the c-FLOW™ is a pared down version used to measure the CBF only.  The use of either of these products (depending on the clinical setting) is key to understand perfusion while helping to direct treatment and lower the cost of patient care. Ornim’s unique technology, protected by 13 worldwide granted and 15 worldwide pending patents, overcome limitations of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and ultrasound Doppler. The patented UTLight™ technology employs the combination of light and ultrasound to provide a non-invasive measure of regional blood oxygen saturation and blood flow.  UTLight™ technology is unique among all other commercially available NIRS technologies, since it also analyzes the light speckle signal and does not rely solely on the intensity of light reaching the detector. Ornim Medical has developed a product range that was born out of a need – a need to measure blood flow directly.   In other words, the products have the capabilities of direct measurement of flow (not surrogate like tissue oximetry); they are intuitive and comprehensive; actionable; the management of blood pressure (BP) according to CBF is intuitive; the measurement is robust and finally they are when adding the BP signal, the Autoregulation function of the organ can be assessed directly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Michal Balberg,11-50,4,Late Stage Venture,2016-08-03,20000000,USD,20000000,Series C,20000000,USD,20000000,Series C,75000000,USD,75000000,75000000,USD,75000000,"OrbiMed, GE Ventures, Fosun International, Agate Medical Investments, LongTec China Ventures",3,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"31,464",8,,,11,,,,,,,,

But isn’t that a little too late? Wouldn’t you rather be in-the-know of what’s going on during the guest’s stay instead of waiting for the guest to leave and then finding out, especially if the guest had a negative experience? It’s kind of like driving a car; you need the engine light or gas tank light to alert you ahead of time so that you can prevent your car from stalling or getting stuck. Imagine if you didn’t have those indicators and were driving never knowing what the status is. If you know in real-time, you can react quickly and solve the issue immediately so that it doesn’t cause problems.  So we’re changing this. No longer will hotel groups have to drive blind. In fact, they and their properties will be empowered with the right information at the right time in order to ensure that every guest leaves their property with a smile.  Their clients use Routier to identify, measure, and monitor their properties’ performance levels in real-time and gain the clarity they need to create benchmarks and data-driven business targets, form incentive programs that improve performance, optimize hotel operations and marketing effectiveness, and ensure all their properties are keeping up with brand standards. Routier’s Unified Performance Index (UPI) is a performance score, available exclusively to Routier clients, used by hotels and brands around the world as their standard measurement tool for benchmarking their properties’ operational and marketing efforts.    Their platform is created to make their clients lives easier; they enable them to receive the information they need easily and react in a scalable manner.  They have a robust set of solutions that are adapted for either guests, properties/staff, or brand/management level. Their guest-facing engagement solution helps hotels and guests communicate with each other in real-time, during their stay, without downloading or installing a thing. Whether you want to measure satisfaction, identify issues, increase your loyalty enrollment, or deliver promotions or other marketing campaigns, you can do this all with their engagement tool.    Routier for Guests: •	Collect guest feedback in real-time and be in-the-know if your guest’s sentiment levels •	Respond quickly to guest needs and ensure no guest leaves your venue unsatisfied •	Create more informed guests by delivering the right message at the right time •	Increase guest satisfaction and loyalty by exceeding guest expectations Their back-of-the-house property solution automates all guest engagement processes for hotels and provides their staff with analytics and insights that improve and optimize staff and hotel performance, guest satisfaction, and ROI.

Multifunction Sensors Enable Human Machine communication.,"42,496",,$1M to $10M,Active,2010-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://vocalzoom.com,https://twitter.com/vocalzoom,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/vocalzoom,michal@vocalzoom.com,972 52 328 4395,12,,"Multifunction Sensors Enable New Generation of Human-to-Machine Communication (HMC) Fueling The Speech-Activated Digital Lifestyle:  VocalZoom Enables  More Natural, Personalized and Secure Voice-Control Experience VocalZoom helps solve one of the biggest challenges facing the move beyond keyboards and touchscreens to a significantly improved user experience (UX) for today’s increasingly mobile and interconnected world.  The problem?  While voice control user interface (UI) solutions have been heralded as the next step, they can’t make devices do as they’re asked without exceeding the threshold of user frustration.  They don’t capture human speech in such a way that a person’s voice can be seamlessly, naturally and conveniently used for everything from controlling virtual assistants, wearable devices and car functions to authenticating individuals for such personalized actions as opening locked doors, transacting, and performing other secure tasks.  Today’s solutions need more and better voice data.  The company’s multifunction HMC sensor technology can help.  The Challenge With human-to-human voice interactions, the goal is to optimize how conversation sounds.  In contrast, the key for human-to-machine interactions using virtual assistants and automotive voice control is whether the machine did what it was told to do, quickly and accurately enough to satisfy the user.  Today’s technologies aren’t up to the task.  Voice processing can improve audio’s overall quality (generally to industry-standard profiles that have been deemed most pleasing to the human ear), but has difficulty with transient or loud sounds typical of real life, such as when a person is surrounded by street noise.  And although noise reduction algorithms used with acoustic microphones have improved, today’s microphones can’t be implemented with enough directional acquisition capabilities to isolate one voice from others, especially in noisy environments.   Human-to-machine interactions demand more precisely targeted voice acquisition, at any noise level, than today’s microphones provide, so machines can identify users, understand their commands and correctly respond to and obey the person authorized to give them instructions.  Achieving a critical combination of authenticated and accurate voice control requires going beyond a simple human-to-machine interface (HMI) to the next-generation, higher-order concept of secure human-to-machine communication (HMC).   Solving the Problem The VocalZoom multifunction HMC sensor adds an important new UX layer:  enabling systems to gather critical additional information exclusively about the user who is communicating with a device.  This information is derived from the optical data generated during speech as facial skin (around such areas as the mouth, lip, cheek and throat) vibrates.  By focusing the VocalZoom HMC sensor on these areas, measuring the vibrations, and converting this data to an audio signal, the speaker’s voice can be isolated, giving voice authentication and control platforms a near-perfect reference signal with which to operate – regardless of noise levels. VocalZoom’s solution will become increasingly important to 1) support growing use of wearables, in-car infotainment systems and other applications where voice control delivers the best, most natural (not requiring looking at or touching) UX, and 2) meet the increasingly important need to employ voice as an authentication factor for an expanding range of personalized on-line and mobile financial, healthcare and other secure cloud-based services.  The sensor can also be used to enhance general voice communication and for applications including proximity sensing, vibration measurement and 3D imaging, creating a new category of multifunction HMC sensors for many simultaneous, high-value UX-focused system capabilities.  Compact and power-efficient, the sensor fits into small devices and is available for both head-mounted (virtual and augmented reality glasses, headsets, helmets) and remote (voice-controlled automotive infotainment and self-service kiosks) applications. Applications Better Performing, More Power-Efficient  and Streamlined Headsets and Other Wearables VocalZoom is redefining head-mounted communication devices in applications from aviation headphones to gaming and virtual/augmented reality gear to emergency response communications solutions.  The performance, size and power efficiency of the multifunction HMC sensor enable system designers to “remove the boom” that was previously required in order to position an acoustic mic close to the user’s voice in a challenging noise environment, cutting costs while improving the user experience.  The Most Convenient Form of Access Control The VocalZoom multifunction HMC sensor provides a single solution for adding voice authentication to voice control solutions.  It delivers a near-perfect isolated signal, becoming the eyes and ears of solutions that can both understand and identify users and ensure they are who they claim to be.   Truly “No-Hands” and Distraction-Free Automotive Voice Control Automotive industry experts from J.D. Powers to the AAA Foundation have concluded that “hands-free” does not yet mean risk-free.  VocalZoom solves this problem with a solution that provides seamless, near-perfect performance in noisy environments.  A single VocalZoom multifunction HMC sensor can be installed in the rear-view mirror and used to authenticate the driver, provide clean, driver-isolated voice commands and potentially deliver additional driver-monitoring capabilities to improve user safety and convenience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Music and Audio, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Tal Bakish,11-50,4,,2015-01-07,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,12700000,USD,12700000,12700000,USD,12700000,"OurCrowd, Motorola Solutions, 3M New Ventures, Radiant Venture Capital, Iris Ventures",1,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"44,061",18,,,14,,,,,,,,

ActivePath began as PostalGuard in 2007 with the goal of providing financial institutions a way to securely communicate with their customers via email. PostalGuard enabled bank customers to view bank statements, transfer funds between accounts, chat with personal financial advisors, and more – all without leaving their email.  The more they learned about their customers' communications and marketing needs, the more they began to realize that there are bigger challenges. It is a problem shared by all web sites and marketers, regardless of the nature of their business. So they expanded their offering to solve for these challenges.  They developed ActiveMail to boost customer engagement and improve email success rates. ActiveMail offers full web functionality, so email marketers can finally offer their customers a rich and interactive experience from within the messages they send. They’ll be able to watch videos, navigate menus, read live updates, share, comment, make purchases, fill out forms, chat with customer service, rate products, interact with rich ad formats and more…inside the email itself.
