As highlighted in the Tezos position paper, the success of any decentralized network is determined by the efforts of a robust, diverse, and flourishing community. The Foundation exists as a part of this ecosystem, alongside developers, scientists, network validators (“bakers”), enthusiasts, and many others all working towards the success of a platform that we believe will ultimately drive innovation on a global scale. The Foundation’s role within the community is to deploy resources that support the long-term future of the Tezos project. Grants and other capital deployment vehicles offer a strategic way to help community members, such as educational and research institutions, developers, or activists from all over the world to support the advancement of the Tezos technology.

Our goal is to fuse emotion intelligence with connected devices, enabling cohesion and understanding between humans and the connected world. Electroencephalography (EEG) imaging of the brain allows us to characterize the way in which our brain processes information. From EEG signals we extract features related to the emotional and cognitive loads of people. While EEG recording has been used in controlled laboratory environments for decades, it has not been integrated into consumer devices that seamlessly integrate with daily life. We believe that daily measurements of the brain will unlock insights that are not possible with only laboratory measurements. Each brain is unique, with its own algorithm that we are focused on decoding. We translate EEG biomarkers from research findings into our product design and build upon research by developing tests that empirically characterize the brain activity resulting from specific environmental inputs.

Our purpose is to deliver productivity through intelligence that safeguards user privacy. Our first product, Typewise Keyboard, is the next-generation keyboard designed specifically for two-thumb typing on smartphones. The idea behind the Typewise Keyboard originated after realizing that our current keyboard was designed for typewriters in the 19th century and is not fit for the mobile age. Yet, it is the most central interface of the smartphone. We use it 76 times every day across all kinds of apps.  Typewise Keyboard reduces typos by 4X through our patented honeycomb layout, enables typing in multiple languages simultaneously, and features autocorrection and text completion that truly understands the user. Most importantly, it doesn't transmit any typing data to the cloud but performs its AI magic fully offline. Our growing user base enables us to continuously improve and demonstrate the scalability of our text prediction technology. In our quest to deliver advanced and private text predictions, we are supported by ETH Zurich and Innosuisse, Switzerland's innovation agency.

To produce knowledge based on data Archilyse uses four generic power-simulations, such as view, geometrical, connectivity and physical analysis, from which countless others can be derived. Their results provide the most comprehensive view on architecture currently available worldwide.  This is how it works: 2D floor plans in the form of PDFs or building image files are converted to 3D BIM-Light models and geo-referenced. Using API (Application Program Interface) calls, professional users can analyse building models drawn from algorithms which translated the latest scientific findings into formulas. The results are presented to users in easy-to-read heatmaps or can be exported in the form of key figure tables for further processing.

This Connected Car Platform, built with open source software hosted on the Azure platform, well protected by Microsoft, has 500,000 users on both iOS and Android, including 40% of the top automotive players in Eastern Europe and Middle East. We sell our product to OEMs, National Sales companies and large dealership groups.  There are three main reasons why automotive companies choose Remoto: 1)	We help them to increase customer retention by creating engaging content and functions for the end-users that keeps their attention on smartphone application and effectively promotes their products and services. 2)	We use Artificial Intelligence to predict customer behaviour in order to find the right moment to upsell to them. That helps OEMs to bring customers back to their dealerships and to increase their revenue. 3)	We develop all the apps, cloud back-end, hardware and machine learning algorithms by ourselves, which is why we can make the project live in 4 months after the contract has been signed. That’s an unbeatable timeframe in the current market. The Remoto solution has already been successfully deployed by several automakers, including Honda, Infiniti, Kia, Toyota, Hyundai, Mitsubishi and Nissan. Moreover, it is being trialled by many vehicle manufacturers around the world, from Europe through to the Middle East and Asia.   Bright Box was declared one of the top five vendors in the Connected Car market from 2017 to 2021 by Technavio, and one of the top 300 companies in the Internet of Things field according to Berg Insight.

The appearance of deposits of the microtubule-associated tau protein as e.g. neurofibrillary tangles in neurons of the brain is a common feature of tauopathies that is shared with Alzheimer’s disease. Neuronal tau deposits are known to be a major contributor to neurodegeneration and mutations in the tau gene are causative of the tauopathy fronto-temporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Due to increasing life expectancy, Alzheimer’s disease is viewed as one of the largest healthcare problems of this century, imposing a major economic burden on societies in the Western and developing world.

Our goal is to stimulate web's users in promoting brands they love through their active participation in creative campaigns tailored purposely for each company.  The users interest in participating to the campaigns is stimulated by the reward they can gain, consisting of virtual credits they can spend on e–commerce; what is necessary and can not be set aside is the user’s preference for the specific product or service which has been the subject of the campaign, as this is the philosophy of Friendz. The aim of the reward is only to encourage users to take and publish high quality pictures when these are associated to the brand. Moreover, the users’s contents are verified and approved by the staff before being published and made visible by other people, so that the company has a further guarantee concerning the quality of the images. Friendz is proposing as a sucessful instrument to solve web’s users problems such as the information overload and the banner blindness. These problems are clear, given the 300 millions downloads of adBlock Plus. For this reason, what is considered as quaestio primaria – as well as our attribute – is the call for an identification of customers’ preferences and the understanding of how they react to the market supply throught their individual taste. The factor Friendz wants to exploit is the emotive issue the association between the product or the service and a familiar component cause to the social networks’ users. This association unconsciously increases the value given to the product or the service: friends are the real influencers. Friendz is the first marketing platform that allows companies to get into people’s social walls and transform their customers in influencers.

JANZZ.technology was originally founded in Zurich in 2008. It is a genuine Swiss company that since the start has been operated by serious investors and experienced personalities from the fields of information and communications technology, human resources, jurisprudence, marketing and business development. The goals of JANZZ.technology are clear: in addition to viable and sustainable business development, the company is strongly focused on ensuring that its products and solutions offer real economic and social benefit. Everyone should be able to benefit from JANZZ.technology, not only in Switzerland, but worldwide. JANZZ.technology launched its first product at the end of 2010: JANZZ.jobs, an innovative employment matching platform designed to reinvigorate labor and job markets, considerably improve on the systems previously used in portals of this kind, and optimize the operations of public employment services. Since 2013 three more, powerful SaaS B2B and B2G solutions were launched – JANZZon!, JANZZclassifier! and JANZZsme! – together with the simple, secure JANZZjobsAPI interface. These solutions, which are superior to conventional full-text-based technologies and applications, have been used in a variety of combinations and applications for structuring and efficiently and intelligently using the large volumes of data available today relating to professional qualifications and hard and soft skills (known as occupation data), as they increase rapidly in complexity. With its cutting-edge solutions, JANZZ.technology is taking a bold step to advance the new area of cognitive computing in the field of occupations and skills. The era of cognitive computing is characterized by a fundamental shift in how machines interact with us, other machines and the environment. The ontology JANZZon! and the smart matching engine JANZZsme! make complex problems such as job and skills matching computable and completely change the way they think and go about job searching. As the applications of JANZZ.technology are structured semantically, that is, occupations, skills and many more concepts are interlinked logically, they can deliver meaningful results for complex searches for job vacancies, employees, freelancers etc. Importantly, these applications constantly learn and therefore become more accurate over time. According to Gartner, the era of cognitive computing, also called the smart machine era will be the most disruptive in the history of IT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",1,Stefan Winzenried,11-50,8,,2018-04-13,4640557,CHF,4824164,Venture - Series Unknown,4640557,CHF,4824164,Venture - Series Unknown,11044164,USD,11044164,11044164,USD,11044164,"Publigroupe S.A., Roberto Oprandi, Advertising, Art & Ideas, Peter Affolter, Hans-Ulrich Doerig",,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"48,379",30,,,6,0,2,,Scientific and electric apparatus and instruments,1405260,USD,1405260,

Traditional VC investors mainly focus on larger deal sizes of more than $100K, leaving small room for individual investors to enter the early stage startup market. Our vision is to disrupt the traditional fund-raising model for startups by enabling individual investors to tap into the venture capital arena with a small ticket size starting from just around hundred dollars.  To enter the platform, startups must either undergo a scoring process by 3rd party analysts or make specific disclosures so as to provide enough information to potential investors.

The company intends to develop its compounds through clinical proof of concept and the identification of an expedited registration strategy, after which pharmaceutical partners will be sought to fund pivotal trials and handle commercialization. Oncoethix founders have an unsurpassed track record in identifying and bringing oncology leads to global markets. Dr. Cvitkovic, Chief Scientific Officer for Oncoethix, led the clinical development of single agent and combination regimens for cisplatin, vindesine, bleomycin, navelbine, and, more recently, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, and trabectedin, first as an academic investigator and then through a specialized oncology clinical research organization. Prior to founding Oncoethix and assuming responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Noel had co-founded another oncology drug development company which in-licensed oxaliplatin as its first portfolio product and subsequently identified, evaluated, and in-licensed novel agents for several clients. Additionally, Dr. Noel has developed expedited registration strategies for many cancer drugs and registration files for a few of these. Dr. Herait managed clinical development of irinotecan, from Phase 1 through Phase 3, while at Rhone Poulenc Rorer and subsequently, as a consultant, managed clinical studies for several novel cancer drugs. Since its founding, Oncoethix has in-licensed three promising cancer drug candidates, each a first-in-class agent to a novel target or with a novel mode of action. Currently, two portfolio compounds are in clinical development. Oncoethix was launched with an initial financing of 1.30 million Swiss francs from the founders to finance portfolio development. In December 2009, the company closed a Series A financing of 3.7 million Swiss francs with leading venture capital firms Index Ventures and Endeavour Vision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,"Esteban Cvitkovic, Kay Noel, Patrice Herait, Yves Paternot",51-100,2,M&A,2013-08-07,18000000,CHF,19503463,Series B,18000000,CHF,19503463,Series B,22200000,CHF,24085464,22200000,CHF,24085464,"Index Ventures, SV Health Investors, Andera Partners, Edmond de Rothschild Private Equity, Endeavour Vision",3,5,,Was Acquired,OncoEthix acquired by Merck,https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/merck-co-inc-acquires-oncoethix--5f60483c,Merck,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merck-co-inc,2014-12-18,day,375000000,USD,375000000,Acquisition,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"54,302",2,,,6,20,1,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,"Pharmaceutical, veterinary and sanitary products",,,,

Together with commonly present neuropathic pain, and lost limb function (nerve injuries), they have no perception or control of the force required to hold or pick up objects and cannot feel their shape or consistency (when using prostheses). A century after the first prosthesis, electrodes, electronics and surgical expertise can be merged into the life-changing solution. Our venture is a synergistic effort converging expertise from microtechnologies, algorithms, electronics and clinical experimentation. We are an EPFL-based startup, founded by Francesco Petrini, Stanisa Raspopovic, and Silvestro Micera. Our mission is to re-enable upper, lower-limb amputees and nerve-damaged persons by: Restoring their complete sensory-motor functionality. Diminishing phantom limb pain. Enabling them to feel the artificial limb as part of their own body. From a market viewpoint, the nerve-injured persons do not have effective ways for function restoration, so we are proposing a novel tech and therefore generating a new market. As for amputees, the prosthetic limbs are getting more sophisticated but lack sensory feedback. We are constructing the game-changing functional improvement of the technology that will become the essential feature of the next-generation of prosthesis. Amputees and peripheral nerve damaged persons are in constant increase, mainly due to diabetes, car accidents, work injuries and wars. Among the most disabling consequences of these is the interruption of sensations flow from extremities to the brain.  The absence of feedback and the perception of prosthesis as a foreign body are the primary reason for refusal to use prosthesis. Amputees cannot feel the shape or material of objects they are holding and have no perception of the force required to hold or pick up objects. Nerve-injured persons often have completely functionally unusable limbs. In 50-80% of cases, amputees and nerve-injured experience neuropathic pain from the missing part of the limb and drugs do not provide adequate relief. Providing them with an adequate sensory feedback would solve their problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnology, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Francesco Maria Petrini, Silvestro Micera, Stanisa Raspopovic",1-10,8,Seed,2019-10-07,3000000,EUR,3291751,Grant,100000,CHF,99215,Seed,100000,CHF,99215,3588098,USD,3588098,"Venture Kick, European Union, EIT Health, EASME - EU Executive Agency for SMEs, Horizon 2020",2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"60,586",20,,,,,,,,,,,

Working as a CDN-overlay solution on growing audiences, Teleport opens the opportunities to reduce rebuffering and raise chunks availability in pikes; rapidly grow the bitrate and overall streaming quality at no significant cost. Teleport operates as the P2P CDN. Unlike traditional CDNs, which always have a limited number of servers, Teleport scales with the growth of the audience. Each new consumer turns from a problem of the server overload, into a solution as an extra bandwidth source. Teleport Media delivers a product that accelerates your CDN and copes with peak loads to provide ultimate service quality for online viewers. By offloading CDN servers up to 80%, we streamline server capacity and bandwidth—it’s WebRTC live streaming with the same number of viewers at a far lower cost.  The Teleport Media solution is charged based on view time rather than gigabytes, meaning that you can invest in attracting larger audiences instead of upgrades for your CDN infrastructure.  Our patented P2P technology for delivering watermarked content offers the unique opportunity to use the WebRTC protocol to stream licensed content in compliance with the license agreement you have with the owner of the content. Whether you’re thinking about boosting your media quality or acquiring new markets and viewers, Teleport WebRTC Streaming relieves you of the technical headache so you can focus on developing your core business.  The integration is as simple as adding a few lines of JS to your online player. We work and are compatible with major online video players, CDNs, and media servers, and bringing us in to integrate with your custom video solution is fast and easy.

But Cecile was also acutely aware that despite affecting almost 1 in 100 people, Celiac Disease was difficult to diagnose. Cecile and her husband Thierry became determined to find a way to change this, giving parents and their children the best chance of an accurate diagnosis and the ability to live their lives free of the often debilitating symptoms. Using Swiss medical expertise Augurix was founded in 2007, with a mission to provide primary care doctors with an easy-to-use, affordable tool, to lower the hurdle of diagnostics. In 2010 Simtomax® was launched – a rapid screening test for the early determination of Celiac Disease at the point-of-care – finally bringing Cecile’s vision to life.

Lymphedema is the chronic swelling that generally occurs in the arms or the legs. Lymphedema is most commonly caused by the removal of or the damage to the lymph nodes as a part of cancer treatment. It results from a blockage in the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. The blockage prevents the lymphatic system from draining excess fluids, and the fluid buildup leads to swelling, infections, and pain. Unfortunately, there is no cure for lymphedema. It can be managed with early diagnosis and diligent care of the affected limb, through daily compression, bandages, and manual drainage sessions. From the moment of the diagnosis, the life of lymphedema patients changes forever. Cancer and cancer-related interventions (i.e. surgery, radiotherapy) are frequent causes of lymphedema occurring both in the upper and lower limbs. Breast cancer survivors are at high risk for developing lymphedema, as well as patients treated for melanoma, pelvic and head and neck cancer or other cancer treatments that require lymph node dissection. Physical trauma can also result in lymphedema, a major cause of lymphatic disease among wounded veterans. Lymphedema is associated with significantly impaired quality of life, skin changes, increased risk of infection and in rare cases lymphedema itself may undergo malignant transformation.

MP-101 is an orally-active modulator of glutamate signalling in spine and brain. Glutamate signalling has long been a sought-after target for the development of new central nervous system drug candidates. MP-101 is a particularly well-suited candidate, with outstanding pharmaceutic properties; it is a small molecule, obtained by a straight-forward chemical manufacturing process. It is also orally active in a wide range of rodent models of central nervous system disorders, such as depression, cognition, or neuropathic pain. MP-101 is a patent-pending non-racemic mixture of the left-handed and right-handed versions (the ""enantiomers"") of dimiracetam. It is not a one-to-one mixture (a ""racemate""), but a ratio that has been chosen because it is - unexpectedly - considerably more potent pharmacologically than the racemate.

IRsweep,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/irsweep,"Health Care, Health Diagnostics, Machinery Manufacturing, Medical Device","Stafa, Zurich, Switzerland",IRsweep provides solutions for faster and more precise mid-IR absorption spectroscopy measurements.,"88,519",,,Active,2014-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://irsweep.com/,https://twitter.com/IRsweep,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/irsweep/,info@irsweep.com,+41 (0)44 545 85 99,,,"IRsweep’s vision is to revolutionize optical sensing by introducing an ultrafast laser spectrometer in the mid‐infrared. It is based on Quantum Cascade Laser Frequency Combs invented by IRsweep Co‐founders in 2012 at ETH Zurich. The spectrometer is the backbone of IRsweep’s commercial activities in the next few years and represents the technological basis for further integration into process analytics and possibly portable applications. A spectrometer is a common piece of equipment in industries and laboratories, used to investigate the molecular composition of a sample in a nondestructive way. The main drawback of today’s spectrometers is their low speed: measurement times of seconds to minutes are needed for the acquisition of a complete spectrum. However, many processes happen on timescales of microseconds, which can’t be observed with these techniques. Moreover, the analysis of large sample numbers takes long. The IRis-F1 is a laser‐based infrared spectrometer which exploits the extraordinary sensing performance of so‐called frequency‐combs in the mid‐infrared spectral region. As a result, the IRis-F1 offers an unmatched combination of high measurement speed (microsecond time resolution) with the high brightness of a laser‐based instrument and a multi‐color output. The high measurement speed of the IRis-F1 opens new possibilities. For example, researchers can observe the folding or conformational changes of proteins in real‐time. By this, they can learn about correct and incorrect protein folding states. With this knowledge, they can find the reason for protein folding errors and eventually cure diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. The spectrometer will moreover enable high throughput screening and the brightness of the laser source enables an analysis of strongly absorbing samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Health Care, Manufacturing",3,"Andreas Hugi, Markus Geiser, Markus Mangold",11-50,4,Seed,2015-12-16,100000,CHF,101059,Pre-Seed,100000,CHF,101059,Pre-Seed,200000,CHF,199034,230000,CHF,230518,Venture Kick,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"92,247",5,,,,,,,,,,,
